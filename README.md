# Smart Lighting System

## Overview
This project implements a **Smart Lighting System** using a **PIC18F4620 microcontroller**, an **LDR (Light-Dependent Resistor)** sensor, and a **PIR (Passive Infrared) sensor**. The system intelligently controls an LED to simulate lighting automation based on ambient light conditions and motion detection. It is programmed in **PIC Assembly Language**.

## Features
1. **Light Control with LDR:**
   - Monitors ambient light levels using an LDR.
   - Automatically turns the LED on in low-light conditions (night) and off in bright conditions (day).
2. **Motion Detection with PIR:**
   - Detects motion using a PIR sensor.
   - Temporarily turns on the LED for 15 seconds if motion is detected, regardless of ambient light.
3. **Timer-Based Delay:**
   - Configures **Timer0** to generate accurate delays for timed LED control.
4. **Debugging Support:**
   - Configures the EUSART module for potential debugging via serial communication.
5. **Interrupt Handling:**
   - High-priority interrupts handle Timer0 and PIR motion detection events.

## Hardware Requirements
- **Microcontroller:** PIC18F4620
- **Sensors:**
  - LDR sensor (connected to the ADC pin `AN0`)
  - PIR sensor (connected to external interrupt pin `INT1`)
- **Output Device:**
  - LED (connected to `RC0`)
- **Power Supply:** 5V regulated power source
- **Additional Components:**
  - Resistors for LDR voltage divider.
  - Capacitors for noise filtering.
  - Breadboard and connecting wires.

---

## Software Requirements
- **Assembler:** MPLAB X IDE with PIC-AS assembler.
- **Simulation:** Proteus for circuit simulation (optional).

## System Architecture
1. **LDR Threshold Logic:**
   - The ADC reads the voltage from the LDR.
   - If the ADC value is below the configured threshold, the system considers it "night" and turns on the LED.
2. **PIR Motion Detection:**
   - If motion is detected, the PIR triggers an external interrupt.
   - The interrupt service routine (ISR) turns on the LED for 15 seconds, regardless of ambient light conditions.
3. **Timer0 Configuration:**
   - Timer0 generates precise delays for system timing.
4. **Interrupt Priority:**
   - PIR interrupts have higher priority than Timer0 to ensure immediate response to motion.
